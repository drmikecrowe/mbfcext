# Changelog

All notable changes to GSD will be documented in this file.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.20.5] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- `/gsd:health --repair` now creates timestamped backup before regenerating STATE.md (#657)

### Changed
- Subagents now discover and load project CLAUDE.md and skills at spawn time for better project context (#671, #672)
- Improved context loading reliability in spawned agents

## [1.20.4] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- Executor agents now update ROADMAP.md and REQUIREMENTS.md after each plan completes — previously both documents stayed unchecked throughout milestone execution
- New `requirements mark-complete` CLI command enables per-plan requirement tracking instead of waiting for phase completion
- Executor final commit includes ROADMAP.md and REQUIREMENTS.md

## [1.20.3] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- Milestone audit now cross-references three independent sources (VERIFICATION.md + SUMMARY frontmatter + REQUIREMENTS.md traceability) instead of single-source phase status checks
- Orphaned requirements (in traceability table but absent from all phase VERIFICATIONs) detected and forced to `unsatisfied`
- Integration checker receives milestone requirement IDs and maps findings to affected requirements
- `complete-milestone` gates on requirements completion before archival — surfaces unchecked requirements with proceed/audit/abort options
- `plan-milestone-gaps` updates REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table (phase assignments, checkbox resets, coverage count) and includes it in commit
- Gemini CLI: escape `${VAR}` shell variables in agent bodies to prevent template validation failures

## [1.20.2] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- Requirements tracking chain now strips bracket syntax (`[REQ-01, REQ-02]` → `REQ-01, REQ-02`) across all agents
- Verifier cross-references requirement IDs from PLAN frontmatter instead of only grepping REQUIREMENTS.md by phase number
- Orphaned requirements (mapped to phase in REQUIREMENTS.md but unclaimed by any plan) are detected and flagged

### Changed
- All `requirements` references across planner, templates, and workflows enforce MUST/REQUIRED/CRITICAL language — no more passive suggestions
- Plan checker now **fails** (blocking, not warning) when any roadmap requirement is absent from all plans
- Researcher receives phase-specific requirement IDs and must output a `<phase_requirements>` mapping table
- Phase requirement IDs extracted from ROADMAP and passed through full chain: researcher → planner → checker → executor → verifier
- Verification report requirements table expanded with Source Plan, Description, and Evidence columns

## [1.20.1] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- Auto-mode (`--auto`) now survives context compaction by persisting `workflow.auto_advance` to config.json on disk
- Checkpoints no longer block auto-mode: human-verify auto-approves, decision auto-selects first option (human-action still stops for auth gates)
- Plan-phase now passes `--auto` flag when spawning execute-phase
- Auto-advance clears on milestone complete to prevent runaway chains

## [1.20.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- `/gsd:health` command — validates `.planning/` directory integrity with `--repair` flag for auto-fixing config.json and STATE.md
- `--full` flag for `/gsd:quick` — enables plan-checking (max 2 iterations) and post-execution verification on quick tasks
- `--auto` flag wired from `/gsd:new-project` through the full phase chain (discuss → plan → execute)
- Auto-advance chains phase execution across full milestones when `workflow.auto_advance` is enabled

### Fixed
- Plans created without user context — `/gsd:plan-phase` warns when no CONTEXT.md exists, `/gsd:discuss-phase` warns when plans already exist (#253)
- OpenCode installer converts `general-purpose` subagent type to OpenCode's `general`
- `/gsd:complete-milestone` respects `commit_docs` setting when merging branches
- Phase directories tracked in git via `.gitkeep` files

## [1.19.2] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- User-level default settings via `~/.gsd/defaults.json` — set GSD defaults across all projects
- Per-agent model overrides — customize which Claude model each agent uses

### Changed
- Completed milestone phase directories are now archived for cleaner project structure
- Wave execution diagram added to README for clearer parallelization visualization

### Fixed
- OpenCode local installs now write config to `./.opencode/` instead of overwriting global `~/.config/opencode/`
- Large JSON payloads write to temp files to prevent truncation in tool calls
- Phase heading matching now supports `####` depth
- Phase padding normalized in insert command
- ESM conflicts prevented by renaming gsd-tools.js to .cjs
- Config directory paths quoted in hook templates for local installs
- Settings file corruption prevented by using Write tool for file creation
- Plan-phase autocomplete fixed by removing "execution" from description
- Executor now has scope boundary and attempt limit to prevent runaway loops

## [1.19.1] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- Auto-advance pipeline: `--auto` flag on `discuss-phase` and `plan-phase` chains discuss → plan → execute without stopping. Also available as `workflow.auto_advance` config setting

### Fixed
- Phase transition routing now routes to `discuss-phase` (not `plan-phase`) when no CONTEXT.md exists — consistent across all workflows (#530)
- ROADMAP progress table plan counts are now computed from disk instead of LLM-edited — deterministic "X/Y Complete" values (#537)
- Verifier uses ROADMAP Success Criteria directly instead of deriving verification truths from the Goal field (#538)
- REQUIREMENTS.md traceability updates when a phase completes
- STATE.md updates after discuss-phase completes (#556)
- AskUserQuestion headers enforced to 12-char max to prevent UI truncation (#559)
- Agent model resolution returns `inherit` instead of hardcoded `opus` (#558)

## [1.19.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- Brave Search integration for researchers (requires BRAVE_API_KEY environment variable)
- GitHub issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
- Security policy for responsible disclosure
- Auto-labeling workflow for new issues

### Fixed
- UAT gaps and debug sessions now auto-resolve after gap-closure phase execution (#580)
- Fall back to ROADMAP.md when phase directory missing (#521)
- Template hook paths for OpenCode/Gemini runtimes (#585)
- Accept both `##` and `###` phase headers, detect malformed ROADMAPs (#598, #599)
- Use `{phase_num}` instead of ambiguous `{phase}` for filenames (#601)
- Add package.json to prevent ESM inheritance issues (#602)

## [1.18.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- `--auto` flag for `/gsd:new-project` — runs research → requirements → roadmap automatically after config questions. Expects idea document via @ reference (e.g., `/gsd:new-project --auto @prd.md`)

### Fixed
- Windows: SessionStart hook now spawns detached process correctly
- Windows: Replaced HEREDOC with literal newlines for git commit compatibility
- Research decision from `/gsd:new-milestone` now persists to config.json

## [1.17.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **gsd-tools verification suite**: `verify plan-structure`, `verify phase-completeness`, `verify references`, `verify commits`, `verify artifacts`, `verify key-links` — deterministic structural checks
- **gsd-tools frontmatter CRUD**: `frontmatter get/set/merge/validate` — safe YAML frontmatter operations with schema validation
- **gsd-tools template fill**: `template fill summary/plan/verification` — pre-filled document skeletons
- **gsd-tools state progression**: `state advance-plan`, `state update-progress`, `state record-metric`, `state add-decision`, `state add-blocker`, `state resolve-blocker`, `state record-session` — automates STATE.md updates
- **Local patch preservation**: Installer now detects locally modified GSD files, backs them up to `gsd-local-patches/`, and creates a manifest for restoration
- `/gsd:reapply-patches` command to merge local modifications back after GSD updates

### Changed
- Agents (executor, planner, plan-checker, verifier) now use gsd-tools for state updates and verification instead of manual markdown parsing
- `/gsd:update` workflow now notifies about backed-up local patches and suggests `/gsd:reapply-patches`

### Fixed
- Added workaround for Claude Code `classifyHandoffIfNeeded` bug that causes false agent failures — execute-phase and quick workflows now spot-check actual output before reporting failure

## [1.16.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- 10 new gsd-tools CLI commands that replace manual AI orchestration of mechanical operations:
  - `phase add <desc>` — append phase to roadmap + create directory
  - `phase insert <after> <desc>` — insert decimal phase
  - `phase remove <N> [--force]` — remove phase with full renumbering
  - `phase complete <N>` — mark done, update state + roadmap, detect milestone end
  - `roadmap analyze` — unified roadmap parser with disk status
  - `milestone complete <ver> [--name]` — archive roadmap/requirements/audit
  - `validate consistency` — check phase numbering and disk/roadmap sync
  - `progress [json|table|bar]` — render progress in various formats
  - `todo complete <file>` — move todo from pending to completed
  - `scaffold [context|uat|verification|phase-dir]` — template generation

### Changed
- Workflows now delegate deterministic operations to gsd-tools CLI, reducing token usage and errors:
  - `remove-phase.md`: 13 manual steps → 1 CLI call + confirm + commit
  - `add-phase.md`: 6 manual steps → 1 CLI call + state update
  - `insert-phase.md`: 7 manual steps → 1 CLI call + state update
  - `complete-milestone.md`: archival delegated to `milestone complete`
  - `progress.md`: roadmap parsing delegated to `roadmap analyze`

### Fixed
- Execute-phase now correctly spawns `gsd-executor` subagents instead of generic task agents
- `commit_docs=false` setting now respected in all `.planning/` commit paths (execute-plan, debugger, reference docs all route through gsd-tools CLI)
- Execute-phase orchestrator no longer bloats context by embedding file content — passes paths instead, letting subagents read in their fresh context
- Windows: Normalized backslash paths in gsd-tools invocations (contributed by @rmindel)

## [1.15.0] - 2026-02-08

### Changed
- Optimized workflow context loading to eliminate redundant file reads, reducing token usage by ~5,000-10,000 tokens per workflow execution

## [1.14.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- Context-optimizing parsing commands in gsd-tools (`phase-plan-index`, `state-snapshot`, `summary-extract`) — reduces agent context usage by returning structured JSON instead of raw file content

### Fixed
- Installer no longer deletes opencode.json on JSONC parse errors — now handles comments, trailing commas, and BOM correctly (#474)

## [1.13.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- `gsd-tools history-digest` — Compiles phase summaries into structured JSON for faster context loading
- `gsd-tools phases list` — Lists phase directories with filtering (replaces fragile `ls | sort -V` patterns)
- `gsd-tools roadmap get-phase` — Extracts phase sections from ROADMAP.md
- `gsd-tools phase next-decimal` — Calculates next decimal phase number for insert operations
- `gsd-tools state get/patch` — Atomic STATE.md field operations
- `gsd-tools template select` — Chooses summary template based on plan complexity
- Summary template variants: minimal (~30 lines), standard (~60 lines), complex (~100 lines)
- Test infrastructure with 22 tests covering new commands

### Changed
- Planner uses two-step context assembly: digest for selection, full SUMMARY for understanding
- Agents migrated from bash patterns to structured gsd-tools commands
- Nested YAML frontmatter parsing now handles `dependency-graph.provides`, `tech-stack.added` correctly

## [1.12.1] - 2026-02-08

### Changed
- Consolidated workflow initialization into compound `init` commands, reducing token usage and improving startup performance
- Updated 24 workflow and agent files to use single-call context gathering instead of multiple atomic calls

## [1.12.0] - 2026-02-07

### Changed
- **Architecture: Thin orchestrator pattern** — Commands now delegate to workflows, reducing command file size by ~75% and improving maintainability

- **Condensed agent prompts** — Same behavior with fewer words (executor, planner, verifier, researcher agents)

### Added
- `gsd-tools.cjs` CLI utility with functions: state load/update, resolve-model, find-phase, commit, verify-summary, generate-slug, current-timestamp, list-todos, verify-path-exists, config-ensure-section

## [1.8.0] - 2026-01-19

### Added
- Uncommitted planning mode: Keep `.planning/` local-only (not committed to git) via `planning.commit_docs: false` in config.json. Useful for OSS contributions, client work, or privacy preferences.
- `/gsd:new-project` now asks about git tracking during initial setup, letting you opt out of committing planning docs from the start

## [1.7.1] - 2026-01-19

### Fixed

## [1.7.0] - 2026-01-19

### Added
- **Quick Mode** (`/gsd:quick`) — Execute small, ad-hoc tasks with GSD guarantees but skip optional agents (researcher, checker, verifier). Quick tasks live in `.planning/quick/` with their own tracking in STATE.md.

## [1.6.2] - 2025-01-17

### Changed
- README restructured with clearer 6-step workflow: init → discuss → plan → execute → verify → complete
- Discuss-phase and verify-work now emphasized as critical steps in core workflow documentation

- `/gsd:discuss-phase` redesigned with intelligent gray area analysis — analyzes phase to identify discussable areas (UI, UX, Behavior, etc.), presents multi-select for user control, deep-dives each area with focused questioning
- Explicit scope guardrail prevents scope creep during discussion — captures deferred ideas without acting on them
- CONTEXT.md template restructured for decisions (domain boundary, decisions by category, Claude's discretion, deferred ideas)
- Downstream awareness: discuss-phase now explicitly documents that CONTEXT.md feeds researcher and planner agents
- `/gsd:plan-phase` now integrates research — spawns `gsd-phase-researcher` before planning unless research exists or `--skip-research` flag used

## [1.5.18] - 2026-01-16

- `workflows/research-project.md` — consolidated into gsd-researcher agent
- `workflows/debug.md` — consolidated into gsd-debugger agent
- `references/research-pitfalls.md` — consolidated into gsd-researcher agent
- `references/debugging.md` — consolidated into gsd-debugger agent
- `references/debug-investigation.md` — consolidated into gsd-debugger agent

## [1.5.15] - 2025-01-15

### Fixed
- **Agents now install correctly** — The `agents/` folder (gsd-executor, gsd-verifier, gsd-integration-checker, gsd-milestone-auditor) was missing from npm package, now included

### Changed
- Consolidated `/gsd:plan-fix` into `/gsd:plan-phase --gaps` for simpler workflow
- UAT file writes now batched instead of per-response for better performance

## [1.5.14] - 2025-01-15

### Fixed
- Plan-phase now always routes to `/gsd:execute-phase` after planning, even for single-plan phases

## [1.5.13] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- `/gsd:new-milestone` now presents research and requirements paths as equal options, matching `/gsd:new-project` format

## [1.5.12] - 2025-01-15

### Changed
- **Milestone cycle reworked for proper requirements flow:**
  - `complete-milestone` now archives AND deletes ROADMAP.md and REQUIREMENTS.md (fresh for next milestone)
  - `new-milestone` is now a "brownfield new-project" — updates PROJECT.md with new goals, routes to define-requirements
  - `discuss-milestone` is now required before `new-milestone` (creates context file)
  - `research-project` is milestone-aware — focuses on new features, ignores already-validated requirements
  - `create-roadmap` continues phase numbering from previous milestone
  - Flow: complete → discuss → new-milestone → research → requirements → roadmap

### Fixed
- `MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` now versioned as `v{version}-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` and archived on completion
- `progress` now correctly routes to `/gsd:discuss-milestone` when between milestones (Route F)

## [1.5.11] - 2025-01-15

### Changed
- Verifier reuses previous must-haves on re-verification instead of re-deriving, focuses deep verification on failed items with quick regression checks on passed items

## [1.5.10] - 2025-01-15

### Changed
- Milestone audit now reads existing phase VERIFICATION.md files instead of re-verifying each phase, aggregates tech debt and deferred gaps, adds `tech_debt` status for non-blocking accumulated debt

### Fixed
- VERIFICATION.md now included in phase completion commit alongside ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, and REQUIREMENTS.md

## [1.5.9] - 2025-01-15

### Added
- Milestone audit system (`/gsd:audit-milestone`) for verifying milestone completion with parallel verification agents

### Changed
- Checkpoint display format improved with box headers and unmissable "→ YOUR ACTION:" prompts
- Subagent colors updated (executor: yellow, integration-checker: blue)
- Execute-phase now recommends `/gsd:audit-milestone` when milestone completes

### Fixed
- Research-phase no longer gatekeeps by domain type

### Removed
- Domain expertise feature (`~/.claude/skills/expertise/`) - was personal tooling not available to other users

## [1.5.8] - 2025-01-15

### Added
- Verification loop: When gaps are found, verifier generates fix plans that execute automatically before re-verifying

### Changed
- `gsd-executor` subagent color changed from red to blue

## [1.5.7] - 2025-01-15

### Added
- `gsd-executor` subagent: Dedicated agent for plan execution with full workflow logic built-in
- `gsd-verifier` subagent: Goal-backward verification that checks if phase goals are actually achieved (not just tasks completed)
- Phase verification: Automatic verification runs when a phase completes to catch stubs and incomplete implementations
- Goal-backward planning reference: Documentation for deriving must-haves from goals

### Changed
- execute-plan and execute-phase now spawn `gsd-executor` subagent instead of using inline workflow
- Roadmap and planning workflows enhanced with goal-backward analysis

### Removed
- Obsolete templates (`checkpoint-resume.md`, `subagent-task-prompt.md`) — logic now lives in subagents

### Fixed
- Updated remaining `general-purpose` subagent references to use `gsd-executor`

## [1.5.6] - 2025-01-15

### Changed
- README: Separated flow into distinct steps (1 → 1.5 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5) making `research-project` clearly optional and `define-requirements` required
- README: Research recommended for quality; skip only for speed

### Fixed
- execute-phase: Phase metadata (timing, wave info) now bundled into single commit instead of separate commits

## [1.5.5] - 2025-01-15

### Changed
- README now documents the `research-project` → `define-requirements` flow (optional but recommended before `create-roadmap`)
- Commands section reorganized into 7 grouped tables (Setup, Execution, Verification, Milestones, Phase Management, Session, Utilities) for easier scanning
- Context Engineering table now includes `research/` and `REQUIREMENTS.md`

## [1.5.4] - 2025-01-15

### Changed
- Research phase now loads REQUIREMENTS.md to focus research on concrete requirements (e.g., "email verification") rather than just high-level roadmap descriptions

## [1.5.3] - 2025-01-15

### Changed
- **execute-phase narration**: Orchestrator now describes what each wave builds before spawning agents, and summarizes what was built after completion. No more staring at opaque status updates.
- **new-project flow**: Now offers two paths — research first (recommended) or define requirements directly (fast path for familiar domains)
- **define-requirements**: Works without prior research. Gathers requirements through conversation when FEATURES.md doesn't exist.

### Removed
- Dead `/gsd:status` command (referenced abandoned background agent model)
- Unused `agent-history.md` template
- `_archive/` directory with old execute-phase version

## [1.5.2] - 2026-01-15

### Added
- Requirements traceability: roadmap phases now include `Requirements:` field listing which REQ-IDs they cover
- plan-phase loads REQUIREMENTS.md and shows phase-specific requirements before planning
- Requirements automatically marked Complete when phase finishes

### Changed
- Workflow preferences (mode, depth, parallelization) now asked in single prompt instead of 3 separate questions
- define-requirements shows full requirements list inline before commit (not just counts)
- Research-project and workflow aligned to both point to define-requirements as next step

### Fixed
- Requirements status now updated by orchestrator (commands) instead of subagent workflow, which couldn't determine phase completion

## [1.5.1] - 2026-01-14

### Changed
- Research agents write their own files directly (STACK.md, FEATURES.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, PITFALLS.md) instead of returning results to orchestrator
- Slimmed principles.md and load it dynamically in core commands

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- New `/gsd:research-project` command for pre-roadmap ecosystem research — spawns parallel agents to investigate stack, features, architecture, and pitfalls before you commit to a roadmap
- New `/gsd:define-requirements` command for scoping v1 requirements from research findings — transforms "what exists in this domain" into "what we're building"
- Requirements traceability: phases now map to specific requirement IDs with 100% coverage validation

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** New project flow is now: `new-project → research-project → define-requirements → create-roadmap`
- Roadmap creation now requires REQUIREMENTS.md and validates all v1 requirements are mapped to phases
- Simplified questioning in new-project to four essentials (vision, core priority, boundaries, constraints)

## [1.4.29] - 2026-01-14

### Removed
- Deleted obsolete `_archive/execute-phase.md` and `status.md` commands
