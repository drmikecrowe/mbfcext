<step name="parse_args">
**Parse arguments:**

Check if `--repair` flag is present in the command arguments.

```
REPAIR_FLAG=""
if arguments contain "--repair"; then
  REPAIR_FLAG="--repair"
fi
```
</step>

<step name="run_health_check">
**Run health validation:**

```bash
node ./.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs validate health $REPAIR_FLAG
```

Parse JSON output:
- `status`: "healthy" | "degraded" | "broken"
- `errors[]`: Critical issues (code, message, fix, repairable)
- `warnings[]`: Non-critical issues
- `info[]`: Informational notes
- `repairable_count`: Number of auto-fixable issues
- `repairs_performed[]`: Actions taken if --repair was used
</step>

<step name="format_output">
**Format and display results:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 GSD Health Check
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Status: HEALTHY | DEGRADED | BROKEN
Errors: N | Warnings: N | Info: N
```

**If repairs were performed:**
```
## Repairs Performed

- ✓ config.json: Created with defaults
- ✓ STATE.md: Regenerated from roadmap
```

**If errors exist:**
```
## Errors

- [E001] config.json: JSON parse error at line 5
  Fix: Run /gsd:health --repair to reset to defaults

- [E002] PROJECT.md not found
  Fix: Run /gsd:new-project to create
```

**If warnings exist:**
```
## Warnings

- [W001] STATE.md references phase 5, but only phases 1-3 exist
  Fix: Run /gsd:health --repair to regenerate

- [W005] Phase directory "1-setup" doesn't follow NN-name format
  Fix: Rename to match pattern (e.g., 01-setup)
```

**If info exists:**
```
## Info

- [I001] 02-implementation/02-01-PLAN.md has no SUMMARY.md
  Note: May be in progress
```

**Footer (if repairable issues exist and --repair was NOT used):**
```
---
N issues can be auto-repaired. Run: /gsd:health --repair
```
</step>

<step name="offer_repair">
**If repairable issues exist and --repair was NOT used:**

Ask user if they want to run repairs:

```
Would you like to run /gsd:health --repair to fix N issues automatically?
```

If yes, re-run with --repair flag and display results.
</step>

<step name="verify_repairs">
**If repairs were performed:**

Re-run health check without --repair to confirm issues are resolved:

```bash
node ./.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs validate health
```

Report final status.

<repair_actions>

| Action | Effect | Risk |
|--------|--------|------|
| createConfig | Create config.json with defaults | None |
| resetConfig | Delete + recreate config.json | Loses custom settings |
| regenerateState | Create STATE.md from ROADMAP structure | Loses session history |

**Not repairable (too risky):**
- PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md content
- Phase directory renaming
- Orphaned plan cleanup
