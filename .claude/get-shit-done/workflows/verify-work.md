<purpose>
Validate built features through conversational testing with persistent state. Creates UAT.md that tracks test progress, survives /clear, and feeds gaps into /gsd:plan-phase --gaps.

User tests, Claude records. One test at a time. Plain text responses.
</purpose>

<philosophy>
**Show expected, ask if reality matches.**

Claude presents what SHOULD happen. User confirms or describes what's different.
- "yes" / "y" / "next" / empty → pass
- Anything else → logged as issue, severity inferred

No Pass/Fail buttons. No severity questions. Just: "Here's what should happen. Does it?"
</philosophy>

<step name="initialize" priority="first">
If $ARGUMENTS contains a phase number, load context:

```bash
INIT=$(node ./.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs init verify-work "${PHASE_ARG}")
```

Parse JSON for: `planner_model`, `checker_model`, `commit_docs`, `phase_found`, `phase_dir`, `phase_number`, `phase_name`, `has_verification`.
</step>

<step name="check_active_session">
**First: Check for active UAT sessions**

```bash
find .planning/phases -name "*-UAT.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

**If active sessions exist AND no $ARGUMENTS provided:**

Read each file's frontmatter (status, phase) and Current Test section.

Display inline:

```
## Active UAT Sessions

| # | Phase | Status | Current Test | Progress |
|---|-------|--------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | 04-comments | testing | 3. Reply to Comment | 2/6 |
| 2 | 05-auth | testing | 1. Login Form | 0/4 |

Reply with a number to resume, or provide a phase number to start new.
```

Wait for user response.

- If user replies with number (1, 2) → Load that file, go to `resume_from_file`
- If user replies with phase number → Treat as new session, go to `create_uat_file`

**If active sessions exist AND $ARGUMENTS provided:**

Check if session exists for that phase. If yes, offer to resume or restart.
If no, continue to `create_uat_file`.

**If no active sessions AND no $ARGUMENTS:**

```
No active UAT sessions.

Provide a phase number to start testing (e.g., /gsd:verify-work 4)
```

**If no active sessions AND $ARGUMENTS provided:**

Continue to `create_uat_file`.
</step>

<step name="find_summaries">
**Find what to test:**

Use `phase_dir` from init (or run init if not already done).

```bash
ls "$phase_dir"/*-SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null
```

Read each SUMMARY.md to extract testable deliverables.
</step>

<step name="extract_tests">
**Extract testable deliverables from SUMMARY.md:**

Parse for:
1. **Accomplishments** - Features/functionality added
2. **User-facing changes** - UI, workflows, interactions

Focus on USER-OBSERVABLE outcomes, not implementation details.

For each deliverable, create a test:
- name: Brief test name
- expected: What the user should see/experience (specific, observable)

Examples:
- Accomplishment: "Added comment threading with infinite nesting"
  → Test: "Reply to a Comment"
  → Expected: "Clicking Reply opens inline composer below comment. Submitting shows reply nested under parent with visual indentation."

Skip internal/non-observable items (refactors, type changes, etc.).
</step>

<step name="create_uat_file">
**Create UAT file with all tests:**

```bash
mkdir -p "$PHASE_DIR"
```

Build test list from extracted deliverables.

Create file:

```markdown

Write to `.planning/phases/XX-name/{phase_num}-UAT.md`

Proceed to `present_test`.
</step>

<step name="present_test">
**Present current test to user:**

Read Current Test section from UAT file.

Display using checkpoint box format:

{expected}

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
→ Type "pass" or describe what's wrong
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Wait for user response (plain text, no AskUserQuestion).
</step>

<step name="process_response">
**Process user response and update file:**

**If response indicates pass:**
- Empty response, "yes", "y", "ok", "pass", "next", "approved", "✓"

Update Tests section:
```
### {N}. {name}
expected: {expected}
result: pass

**If response indicates skip:**
- "skip", "can't test", "n/a"

Update Tests section:
```
### {N}. {name}
expected: {expected}
result: skipped
reason: [user's reason if provided]
```

**If response is anything else:**
- Treat as issue description

Infer severity from description:
- Contains: crash, error, exception, fails, broken, unusable → blocker
- Contains: doesn't work, wrong, missing, can't → major
- Contains: slow, weird, off, minor, small → minor
- Contains: color, font, spacing, alignment, visual → cosmetic
- Default if unclear: major

Update Tests section:
```
### {N}. {name}
expected: {expected}
result: issue
reported: "{verbatim user response}"
severity: {inferred}
```

Append to Gaps section (structured YAML for plan-phase --gaps):
```yaml
- truth: "{expected behavior from test}"
  status: failed
  reason: "User reported: {verbatim user response}"
  severity: {inferred}
  test: {N}
  artifacts: []  # Filled by diagnosis
  missing: []    # Filled by diagnosis
```

**After any response:**

Update Summary counts.
Update frontmatter.updated timestamp.

If more tests remain → Update Current Test, go to `present_test`
If no more tests → Go to `complete_session`
</step>

<step name="resume_from_file">
**Resume testing from UAT file:**

Read the full UAT file.

Find first test with `result: [pending]`.

Announce:
```
Resuming: Phase {phase} UAT
Progress: {passed + issues + skipped}/{total}
Issues found so far: {issues count}

Continuing from Test {N}...
```

Update Current Test section with the pending test.
Proceed to `present_test`.
</step>

<step name="complete_session">
**Complete testing and commit:**

Update frontmatter:
- status: complete

Clear Current Test section:
```
## Current Test

**Diagnose root causes before planning fixes:**

{N} issues found. Diagnosing root causes...

- Load diagnose-issues workflow
- Follow @./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/diagnose-issues.md
- Spawn parallel debug agents for each issue
- Collect root causes
- Update UAT.md with root causes
- Proceed to `plan_gap_closure`

Diagnosis runs automatically - no user prompt. Parallel agents investigate simultaneously, so overhead is minimal and fixes are more accurate.

**Batched writes for efficiency:**

Keep results in memory. Write to file only when:
1. **Issue found** — Preserve the problem immediately
2. **Session complete** — Final write before commit
3. **Checkpoint** — Every 5 passed tests (safety net)

| Frontmatter.status | OVERWRITE | Start, complete |
| Frontmatter.updated | OVERWRITE | On any file write |
| Current Test | OVERWRITE | On any file write |

<severity_inference>
**Infer severity from user's natural language:**

| User says | Infer |
|-----------|-------|
| "crashes", "error", "exception", "fails completely" | blocker |
| "doesn't work", "nothing happens", "wrong behavior" | major |
| "works but...", "slow", "weird", "minor issue" | minor |
| "color", "spacing", "alignment", "looks off" | cosmetic |

Default to **major** if unclear. User can correct if needed.

**Never ask "how severe is this?"** - just infer and move on.
