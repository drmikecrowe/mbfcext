## Initial Roadmap (v1.0 Greenfield)

```markdown
# Roadmap: [Project Name]

## Overview

[One paragraph describing the journey from start to finish]

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [ ] **Phase 1: [Name]** - [One-line description]
- [ ] **Phase 2: [Name]** - [One-line description]
- [ ] **Phase 3: [Name]** - [One-line description]
- [ ] **Phase 4: [Name]** - [One-line description]

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: [Name]
**Goal**: [What this phase delivers]
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: [REQ-01, REQ-02, REQ-03]  <!-- brackets optional, parser handles both formats -->

  1. [Observable behavior from user perspective]
  2. [Observable behavior from user perspective]
  3. [Observable behavior from user perspective]
**Plans**: [Number of plans, e.g., "3 plans" or "TBD"]

Plans:
- [ ] 01-01: [Brief description of first plan]

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. [Observable behavior from user perspective]
  2. [Observable behavior from user perspective]
**Plans**: [Number of plans]

- [ ] 04-01: [Brief description]

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute in numeric order: 2 → 2.1 → 2.2 → 3 → 3.1 → 4

| Phase | Plans Complete | Status | Completed |
|-------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| 1. [Name] | 0/3 | Not started | - |
| 2. [Name] | 0/2 | Not started | - |
| 3. [Name] | 0/2 | Not started | - |
| 4. [Name] | 0/1 | Not started | - |
```

<guidelines>
**Initial planning (v1.0):**
- Phase count depends on depth setting (quick: 3-5, standard: 5-8, comprehensive: 8-12)
- Each phase delivers something coherent
- Phases can have 1+ plans (split if >3 tasks or multiple subsystems)
- Plans use naming: {phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md (e.g., 01-02-PLAN.md)
- No time estimates (this isn't enterprise PM)
- Progress table updated by execute workflow
- Plan count can be "TBD" initially, refined during planning

**Success criteria:**
- 2-5 observable behaviors per phase (from user's perspective)
- Cross-checked against requirements during roadmap creation
- Flow downstream to `must_haves` in plan-phase
- Verified by verify-phase after execution
- Format: "User can [action]" or "[Thing] works/exists"

**After milestones ship:**
- Collapse completed milestones in `<details>` tags
- Add new milestone sections for upcoming work
- Keep continuous phase numbering (never restart at 01)
</guidelines>

<status_values>
- `Not started` - Haven't begun
- `In progress` - Currently working
- `Complete` - Done (add completion date)
- `Deferred` - Pushed to later (with reason)
</status_values>

## Milestone-Grouped Roadmap (After v1.0 Ships)

After completing first milestone, reorganize with milestone groupings:

```markdown
# Roadmap: [Project Name]

- ✅ **v1.0 MVP** - Phases 1-4 (shipped YYYY-MM-DD)
- 🚧 **v1.1 [Name]** - Phases 5-6 (in progress)
- 📋 **v2.0 [Name]** - Phases 7-10 (planned)

## Progress

| Phase | Milestone | Plans Complete | Status | Completed |
|-------|-----------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| 1. Foundation | v1.0 | 3/3 | Complete | YYYY-MM-DD |

- Completed milestones collapsed in `<details>` for readability
- Current/future milestones expanded
- Continuous phase numbering (01-99)
- Progress table includes milestone column
