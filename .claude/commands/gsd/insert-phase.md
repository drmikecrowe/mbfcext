<objective>
Insert a decimal phase for urgent work discovered mid-milestone that must be completed between existing integer phases.

Uses decimal numbering (72.1, 72.2, etc.) to preserve the logical sequence of planned phases while accommodating urgent insertions.

Purpose: Handle urgent work discovered during execution without renumbering entire roadmap.

<context>
Arguments: $ARGUMENTS (format: <after-phase-number> <description>)

Roadmap and state are resolved in-workflow via `init phase-op` and targeted tool calls.
</context>

<process>
Execute the insert-phase workflow from @./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/insert-phase.md end-to-end.
Preserve all validation gates (argument parsing, phase verification, decimal calculation, roadmap updates).
