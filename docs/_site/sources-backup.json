The ACLU in their blog section and even news section often cite to places like the Huffington Post for news articles but sometimes they will use basic reporting like AP or Reuters. Beyond their news and blog posts most of the site covers issues that are often considered more liberal causes but most often it is consistent with their stance on the rights they champion. The ACLU has defended the KKK, Pro Abortion, and Neo-Nazi’s right to assemble and protest (1 2 3).  They will often be accused of being left biased as they do not advocate for gun rights, however they equally do not champion gun regulations either.  A quick search for Gun Rights or even Guns will yield no results or results only related to search and seizure cases they have taken on.  They do not agree on the individuals rights to own firearms but do not advocate on their beliefs.  They have teamed up with the NRA several times in a sort of odd fellowship (4). Their Blog & News feed’s can often be filled with more left leaning stances, but they are not biased in their case work load or defending the rights they advocate for. There have been times Justice Scalia the most outspoken and most conservative justice at the time had ideas that line up with the ACLU (5). Most modern conservatives may often take issue with much of what the ACLU advocates and litigates in courts. However, the ACLU has defended religious freedoms in the school as well. Including the right to pray in school (6). I would try to advocate that the ACLU is more neutral than left, but with the major shift in American politics to the right, I can no longer advocate that stance. (M.

Most of these words appeared in headlines when the topic was about liberal politicians or liberal policy.

Most articles contain loaded sensationalized headlines and have minimal to poor sourcing in the body of the articles. For example, they source Infowars in one article, which is a very popular conspiracy website. In another article, they make claims that a fact checker is funded by George Soros and Hillary Clinton sympathizers, without providing evidence such as a link or name of their source. This is not only dishonest, it can be classified as libel (a published false statement that is damaging to a person’s reputation; a written defamation.) Further, in this same article they claim the fact checker is run by Khoop-Consortium, which is supposedly a “left-wing anarchist group.” Our research reveals that this group does not exist on the web. We are not claiming they do not exist at all, just that we cannot find them. The author then goes on to claim he is filing a lawsuit against this fact checker, which is surprising since the author is defaming the fact checker in his own article.

In other words, this source primarily produces pro-right propaganda (information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote a political cause or point of view).

Trump Just Went On Twitter & EXPOSED Obama’s Sick Plan! **MAKE THIS GO VIRAL.” The words “Sick Plan” is a highly negative connotation that attempts to blame former President Obama for a judges decision, where there isn’t evidence to support it. Further, in this same article they copy and paste this quote as evidence of Obama’s “sick plan”: “JUDGE WILLIAM H. ORRICK, THE FEDERAL JUDGE IN SAN FRANSISCO (spelling error), WHO BLOCKED TRUMP’S ORDER THAT WOULD DEFUND SANCTUARY CITIES, IS AN OBAMA DONOR WHO GAVE $200,000 TO GET HIM ELECTED!” There isn’t a source for this quote, so we don’t know who said it or made that claim, in fact there isn’t any source at all for this news article other than some tweets from President Trump. Furthermore, Judge Orrick did not donate 200K to Obama. He helped raise 200K through fundraising and donated 30.8K to committees supporting Obama. Whether he donated to Obama or not is not evidence of a “sick plan” to block Trump. This is a classic clickbait tactic and promotion of propaganda.
