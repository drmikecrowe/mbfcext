Are you tired of navigating through a sea of biased news stories while browsing Facebook? Do you wish you had a tool that could help you distinguish between reliable sources and those that may present a skewed or extreme perspective? Look no further! The Media Bias/Fact Check Extension is here to revolutionize your news consumption experience.

Our browser extension harnesses the power of [Media Bias/Fact Check Website](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com), a trusted platform that has meticulously curated a database of over 6000 news sites. With its detailed bias and reporting analysis, we bring you a unique solution to combat the overwhelming flood of misinformation and biased reporting in today's media landscape.

Here's how it works:

- We leverage the comprehensive data from [Media Bias/Fact Check Website](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com) to provide you with invaluable insights into the credibility and bias of news sources. With just a glance, you can discern if the article you're reading comes from a source known for extreme bias or if its reporting quality is questionable.
- Customizable Site Filtering: Tailor your news feed to your preferences and values. The extension allows you to configure your settings to automatically collapse stories from fake news sites, sources with extreme bias, or those with mixed reporting quality. Take control of your information intake and ensure a more balanced news consumption experience.
- Bias Rating Icon: As you browse the web, our extension dynamically changes its icon to indicate the bias of the site you're visiting. Whether it leans left, right, or falls within the center, you'll be instantly aware of the site's political positioning. If you've selected to collapse a site on Facebook due to extreme bias, the icon will even flash, alerting you to potentially misleading content.
- Additional Ratings: Our extension goes beyond the traditional left-right rating system. It provides additional insights such as whether a site is Pro Science, Satire, or notorious for spreading Fake News. These nuanced ratings offer a more comprehensive view of a source's overall reliability and intentions.
- Say Goodbye to Sponsored Stories: We've added a brand new feature that lets you collapse Facebook sponsored stories strategically placed in your news feed to promote products and services. Focus on authentic news content without the distraction of intrusive advertisements masquerading as news articles.

The Media Bias/Fact Check Extension is your trusty sidekick in the quest for unbiased news. With its arsenal of features, you'll become a more informed and discerning consumer of information, confidently navigating the treacherous waters of media bias and misinformation.

Install the extension now and let the truth shine through the noise!
