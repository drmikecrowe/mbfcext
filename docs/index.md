# Media Bias/Fact Check Extension

See source credibility ratings directly in your Facebook feed.

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/official-media-biasfact-c/ganicjnkcddicfioohdaegodjodcbkkh)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/media-bias-fact-check/)

## How It Works

The extension uses data from [Media Bias/Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com) — a database of 6,000+ news sources with bias and credibility ratings.

**On Facebook:** Bias badges appear automatically on news posts, showing the source's political leaning and factual reporting quality.

**On any site:** Click the extension icon to see bias info for the current domain.

## Features

- **Bias badges** — Color-coded ratings (Left, Right, Center, etc.) on Facebook news posts
- **Factual reporting** — See if a source has high, mixed, or low factual accuracy
- **News search** — Search for more information about any article
- **Collapse filters** — Automatically collapse stories from sources you want to avoid
- **Sponsored story control** — Hide promoted content in your feed
- **Icon indicator** — Extension icon changes to show the current site's bias

## Privacy

The extension may collect **anonymous** usage data to improve recommendations:

- Unrated domains viewed frequently (recommended for MBFC analysis)
- Site ratings displayed
- Sites ignored by user preference

No personal data is collected. See our [privacy policy](privacy.md) for details.
