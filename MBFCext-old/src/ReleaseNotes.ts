<li>Reporting: The reporting analysis by <a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com">Media Bias/Fact Check</a></li>
<li>References: This is <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/what-is-link-equity">Moz&#39;s Link equity</a>, once colloquially referred to with the awful term &quot;link juice,&quot; is a search engine ranking factor based on the idea that certain links pass value and authority from one page to another. This value is dependent on a number of factors, such as the linking page&#39;s authority, topical relevance, HTTP status, and more. Links that pass equity are one of many signals that Google and other search engines use to determine a page&#39;s rankings in the SERPs. Moz&#39;s Link Equity analysis.</li>
<li>Popularity: Of the 2000+ MBFC sites, this indicates the where this site falls in the continuum of sites analyzed. Sites with few References (Link Equity) are close to 0% in popularity. Sites with 3M References are at 100%. This percentage should help you determine how seriously to take the site.</li>
